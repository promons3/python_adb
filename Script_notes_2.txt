List of modifications in Script v2.1:
-log folder name to be changed :From “AppTesting_On_DDMMYYYY - DONE
-Script starts some home window or dashboard automatically, eliminate this if possible: Using the 'Intent' to launch an app rather than ActivityName: added monkeyrunner support
-Detect newly connected/disconnected devices and test the next app: For this the code snippet as added & it's working
-remove package name activity name in console and add some information if they are not there:it will print the only available things not others
-if log file/folder already present > Create new or create new folder: I've added workaround code for this as it will create different folder for the apps in main folder.
-Device names to be printed in adb log instead of device ID: I've created a static module for this and it's working with one device but not working if multiple devices are connected.
-Network path: it will work for folder path but not if you drag a file to the cmd.

In-progress:-
-Coloring of app name and device being tested  - I’ve added different modules for colors as well but still not working as expected.

Not Completed:-
-Long path should be accepted by the script - getting an error 'parameter [87] for long files' name
-Pause feature if possible (Pause at the logical end at the script, if not at the same point) - Checked it out with Python Debugger but in python '3.6.4', that module is not matching.
