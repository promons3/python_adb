New implementation:-
1. Added a new code to kill 'shell'/'child process'.   

Fixed Issues in python:-
 1. I've removed the '-d' option from the 'adb logcat' command inside the Popen, previously it was dumping the log to file and then used to get quit.
 2. Removed the time pause from underneath of the 'subprocess.Popen(['adb', '-s', device_id, 'logcat', '-v', 'threadtime'], stdout=f1, shell=True)' command, which was causing an issue of not logging the start part of the device log.
 3. Change the logging command position, as previously it was after the launching of the app, in this logging will start before launching the app.
 4. Resolved the issue all log file keeping update continuously in all available folders

Known Issue(s):-
1. UnboundLocalError appears when device got disconnected.
